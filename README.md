**"PROJECT LIBRARY OF DOOOOOOOM"** -->
*This application allows the user to make a custom library of projects from outside sources. They can save links to the original source, make lists of necessary supplies and tools necessary to complete their project, and indicate the status of the project. They can also create a list of supplies and tools they already have, in order to better avoid accidentally making duplicate purchases. The app employs full CRUD functionality, allowing the user to create a project, view it on a separate page, update it if necessary, and delete it if they wish. The app is also confirured to use OAuth authentication. Currently, it is only configured for Google OAuth.*

**GETTING STARTED**
- link to come in the future once we are able to deploy...

**NEXT STEPS**
- Add additional funcitonality to the Stash, as well as integrate views of user's current inventory to project views (allowing for fewer clicks back and forth). 

- add view of projects with the tag "current" to display on the home page, so users can have quick access to source materials for the project.

- add thumbnails and image support for projects.
